# CI/CD Pipeline Guide

This repository uses GitHub Actions for continuous integration and deployment. All changes must pass automated checks before being merged to the main branch.

## üõ°Ô∏è Branch Protection

### Main Branch Rules
- **Direct commits to main are PROHIBITED**
- All changes must go through Pull Requests
- Minimum 2 reviewers required
- All status checks must pass
- Branch must be up-to-date before merging

### Required Status Checks
‚úÖ Backend Tests & Linting  
‚úÖ Frontend Tests & Linting  
‚úÖ Security & Dependency Checks  
‚úÖ Quality Gate  
‚úÖ PR Validation  
‚úÖ Code Coverage Report  
‚úÖ Dependency Review  

## üîÑ Workflow Overview

### 1. Continuous Integration (`ci.yml`)
**Triggers:** Push to main/develop, Pull Requests

**Backend Pipeline:**
- Python 3.12 setup with uv package manager
- PostgreSQL test database setup
- Install dependencies with `uv sync`
- Run linting with `./scripts/lint.sh --check`
- Run type checking with mypy
- Execute test suite with pytest
- Generate test reports

**Frontend Pipeline:**
- Node.js 20 setup with npm caching
- Install dependencies with `npm ci`
- Run ESLint for code quality
- Run TypeScript type checking
- Execute test suite (when available)
- Build production bundle

**Security Checks:**
- Trivy vulnerability scanner
- Dependency vulnerability assessment
- SARIF report upload to GitHub Security

**Integration Tests:**
- Full stack integration testing
- Database migration verification
- API endpoint validation

### 2. Pull Request Checks (`pr-checks.yml`)
**Triggers:** PR opened, synchronized, reopened

**Validations:**
- Semantic commit message format
- PR title and description quality
- Breaking change detection
- PR size analysis (warns on large PRs)
- Code coverage reporting
- Dependency security review

**Automated Comments:**
- Large PR warnings
- Breaking change notifications
- Coverage reports with Codecov integration

### 3. Release Workflow (`release.yml`)
**Triggers:** Tags starting with 'v', push to main

**Release Process:**
- Automated changelog generation
- GitHub release creation with installation instructions
- Staging deployment pipeline
- Production deployment (on version tags)

### 4. Dependency Management (`dependency-updates.yml`)
**Triggers:** Weekly schedule (Mondays 9 AM UTC), Manual dispatch

**Automated Updates:**
- Python dependencies via uv
- Node.js dependencies via npm
- Security vulnerability fixes
- Automated PR creation for updates
- Critical vulnerability issue creation

## üöÄ Development Workflow

### Standard Development Process

1. **Create Feature Branch**
   ```bash
   git checkout -b feat/your-feature-name
   ```

2. **Make Changes & Commit**
   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "feat: add new feature description"
   ```

3. **Push and Create PR**
   ```bash
   git push origin feat/your-feature-name
   ```
   - Create PR through GitHub UI
   - Add descriptive title and description
   - Link related issues
   - Request reviewers

4. **PR Review Process**
   - Automated checks run (CI pipeline)
   - Code review by team members
   - Address feedback and update PR
   - All checks must pass ‚úÖ

5. **Merge to Main**
   - Squash and merge recommended
   - Delete feature branch after merge
   - Automated deployment to staging

### Commit Message Format

Use [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/) format:

```
<type>: <description>

[optional body]

[optional footer]
```

**Types:**
- `feat`: New feature
- `fix`: Bug fix
- `docs`: Documentation changes
- `style`: Code style (formatting, missing semicolons, etc.)
- `refactor`: Code refactoring
- `perf`: Performance improvements
- `test`: Adding/updating tests
- `chore`: Maintenance tasks
- `ci`: CI/CD changes

**Examples:**
```
feat: add user authentication system
fix: resolve currency conversion rounding bug
docs: update API documentation with new endpoints
test: add unit tests for insights service
```

## üîß Local Development Setup

### Backend Testing
```bash
cd backend
uv sync --dev
./scripts/lint.sh  # Run linting
uv run python -m pytest tests/ -v  # Run tests
```

### Frontend Testing
```bash
cd finance-dashboard
npm install
npm run lint  # Run linting
npm run typecheck  # Type checking
npm test  # Run tests
npm run build  # Build production
```

## üìä Quality Gates

### Code Coverage
- Minimum 70% code coverage required
- Coverage reports generated with pytest-cov
- Results uploaded to Codecov
- Coverage trends tracked in PRs

### Code Quality Standards
- **Backend:** Ruff linting + mypy type checking
- **Frontend:** ESLint + TypeScript strict mode
- **Security:** Trivy vulnerability scanning
- **Dependencies:** Automated security audits

### Performance Requirements
- Backend tests must complete in < 5 minutes
- Frontend build must complete in < 3 minutes
- Integration tests must complete in < 10 minutes

## üö® Security & Compliance

### Automated Security Checks
- **Dependency scanning** for known vulnerabilities
- **Secret scanning** to prevent credential leaks
- **Code analysis** with CodeQL
- **Container scanning** with Trivy

### Security Incident Response
1. Critical vulnerabilities trigger automatic issues
2. Security patches get high priority review
3. Emergency hotfix process available
4. Security advisories published for major issues

## üéØ Monitoring & Observability

### CI/CD Metrics
- Build success/failure rates
- Test execution times
- Deployment frequency
- Lead time for changes

### Alerts & Notifications
- Failed builds notify team immediately
- Security vulnerabilities create high-priority issues
- Large PRs get automated warnings
- Breaking changes require team coordination

## üõ†Ô∏è Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**‚ùå Tests failing locally but passing in CI**
- Check Python/Node.js versions match CI
- Ensure database migrations are up to date
- Verify environment variables are set correctly

**‚ùå Linting errors**
```bash
# Backend
cd backend && ./scripts/lint.sh --fix

# Frontend  
cd finance-dashboard && npm run lint -- --fix
```

**‚ùå Type checking errors**
```bash
# Backend
cd backend && uv run python -m mypy src/

# Frontend
cd finance-dashboard && npm run typecheck
```

**‚ùå Dependency conflicts**
```bash
# Backend - regenerate lock file
cd backend && rm uv.lock && uv sync

# Frontend - clean install
cd finance-dashboard && rm -rf node_modules package-lock.json && npm install
```
